			Rhubarb (Rheum rhabarbarum) is a species of plant in the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonaceae">Polygonaceae</a>. It is a herbaceous perennial growing from short, thick rhizomes. It produces large poisonous leaves that are somewhat triangular, with long fleshy edible stalks and small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower">flowers</a> grouped in large compound leafy greenish-white to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescence">rose-red inflorescences</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In culinary use, fresh raw leaf stalks (petioles) are crisp (similar to celery) with a strong, tart taste. Although rhubarb is not a true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit">fruit</a>, in the kitchen it is usually prepared as if it were. Most commonly, the stalks are cooked with sugar and used in pies, crumbles and other desserts. A number of varieties have been domesticated for human consumption, most of which are recognised as Rheum x hybridum by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Horticultural_Society">Royal Horticultural Society</a>.

			Rhubarb contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthraquinones">anthraquinones</a> including rhein, and emodin and their glycosides (e.g. glucorhein), which impart cathartic and laxative properties. It is hence useful as a cathartic in case of constipation.
